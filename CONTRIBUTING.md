## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/jamesylgan/codelabs-tezos/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/jamesylgan/codelabs-tezos/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide or a feature, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

Any pull requests should be made to the **develop** branch. Once the develop version is fully ready, it will be added to release and merged to **main** or master branch upon the agreement of the majority of contributors. We may also pass some unit tests or formal verification.
